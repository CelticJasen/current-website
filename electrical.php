      <div align="left"><span class="maintext">Current Inc. offers many electrical services, for both residential, and commercial applications. We have highly trained staff with plenty of experience to get your job done right. Our focus is always on our customers, and their needs.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="maintext"><strong>RESIDENTIAL:</strong><br />
          From simply changing a light bulb to completely wiring a newly built 5 story house, we can handle it. No job is too big, or too small. If you have an idea on what you want in your house, but aren't sure what you need, let us know. We have access to many products to customize any house for your electrical needs and wants. </p>
        <p class="maintext"><strong>COMMERCIAL:</strong><br />
          Current Inc. has a wide range of tools, experience, and knowledge to handle your commercial needs. We've got conduit benders, pipe threaders, wire pullers, and many more tools essential for any commercial application.

        <p class="maintext"><strong><img src="images/Bucket Truck350.jpg" alt="Bucket truck" width="350" height="180" border="0" align="right" />BUCKET TRUCK:</strong><br />
          Speaking of commercial needs, do you have a parking lot light not working, or maybe just a tall building? It's not a problem, we can reach it. We have a bucket truck that can get our electricians 65' in the air, and we aren't afraid to use it. We also have our own scissor lift as well as scaffolding to reach those tall ceilings inside buildings. We definitely aren't afraid of heights.</p>
        <p class="maintext"><strong>GENERATORS:</strong><br />
          You bet, we have those as well. For both commercial and residential needs, we can install the right stand by generator for you. We are a Rheem generator dealer, and can keep you with power when everyone else looses power. Whether you have propane, or natural gas, we can get the generator that is right for you. </p>
        <p><span class="maintext"> Current Inc. is the place to go for all of your electrical needs. Our friendly staff can help you with any questions or concerns, and we also offer free estimates. If you have a project coming up, or just need service on your existing equipment, <strong>give us a call at 417-257-0504.</strong></span></p>
