            <p class="maintext"><strong>RESIDENTIAL:</strong><br />
              From simply changing a light bulb to completely wiring a newly built 5 story house, we can handle it. No job is too big, or too small. If you have an idea on what you want in your house, but aren't sure what you need, let us know. We have access to many products to customize any house for your electrical needs and wants. </p>
            <p class="maintext"><strong>COMMERCIAL:</strong><br />
              Current Inc. has a wide range of tools, experience, and knowledge to handle your commercial needs. We've got conduit benders, pipe threaders, wire pullers, and many more tools essential for any commercial application. Along with access to many suppliers to get all the right equipment and products to meet any specifications. Your commercial needs are covered with Current Inc.</p>
            <p class="maintext"><strong>BUCKET TRUCK:</strong><br />
              Speaking of commercial needs, do you have a parking lot light not working, or maybe just a tall building? It's not a problem, we can reach it. We have a bucket truck that can get our electricians 65' in the air, and we aren't afraid to use it. We also have our own scissor lift as well as scaffolding to reach those tall ceilings inside buildings. We definitely aren't afraid of heights.</p>
            <p class="maintext"><strong>GENERATORS:</strong><br />
              You bet, we have those as well. For both commercial and residential needs, we can install the right stand by generator for you. We are a Rheem generator dealer, and can keep you with power when everyone else looses power. Whether you have propane, or natural gas, we can get the generator that is right for you. </p>
          <p><span class="maintext"> Current Inc. is the place to go for all of your electrical needs. Our friendly staff can help you with any questions or concerns, and we also offer free estimates. If you have a project coming up, or just need service on your existing equipment, give us a call at 417-257-0504.</span></p></td>
          <td valign="top"><span class="maintext"><strong>At CURRENT, Inc.</strong>, we service all brands and models of  conventional and geothermal equipment.   That includes the simplest repairs to large overhauls.  We also offer emergency repair services.
            </p>
            </span>
            <p class="maintext"><strong>ZONING: </strong> <br />
            With  zoning, you can keep different areas of your home at different  temperatures.  If you like your bedroom  at one temperature and your living room at another, Zoning is your answer.  We can work together and design a zoning  system for you entire living area.  This  can be done without adding tonnage or additional units.</p>
            <p class="maintext"><strong>DUCTWORK:</strong>  <br />
            Many  house plans do not allow enough room for ductwork.  Since it is hidden from view, sometimes  planning for it fails.  EVERY system we  install is a custom design to match the customer's needs.  We cover every aspect of the system from the  amount air that goes into a room to where the ductwork will lie.</p>
            <p class="maintext"><strong>DUCT CLEANING:<br />
            </strong>The world we live in is full of dust, pollen and other  airborne particles. <br />
          All of these settle in your ductwork and are recirculated  throughout your house every time your unit runs.  By having your ductwork cleaned, you can  reduce the levels of all these pollutants, helping you and your family breathe  easier and your unit to run more efficiently.</p>
          <p class="maintext">If you have a project coming up, or just need service on your existing equipment, give us a call at 417-257-0504.</p></td>
