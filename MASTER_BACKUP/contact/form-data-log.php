A friend suggested we call current for internet since we would not be able to use the same company we previously used in town. My husband called and requested service before we moved and was told it would be 2 weeks, that's reasonable, no problem. Two weeks passed and no internet. So my husband called again, the wrong address was written down, call back in a few days...ok..next phone call, putting in new towers, hiring more employees, we will have someone call you. No call. Yesterday, we will send someone to see if service is available for you today. No one came...we thought we were waiting to be hooked up, now we arent sure if service is available. No one is returning our call, no one has answered our questions.its been over a month,wed just like to know if it's going to be days? Weeks? Months? Any answer would be appreciated."
